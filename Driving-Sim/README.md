# Driving Simulator - Manual Navigation

A browser-based driving simulation website that allows users to manually navigate from a starting location to a destination using Mapbox GL JS and OpenStreetMap data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Manual Navigation**: Click/tap on roads to move your vehicle
- **Road-Only Movement**: Movement is restricted to roads only using Mapbox routing validation
- **Real-time Tracking**: Timer starts when you begin moving and stops when you reach the destination
- **Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates using Mapbox Geocoding API
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Satellite Toggle**: Switch between street and satellite view
- **Path Logging**: Tracks your route for analysis
- **Success Detection**: Automatically detects when you're within 25 meters of the destination

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Mapbox Access Token

1. Go to [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and create a free account
2. Navigate to your [Account page](https://account.mapbox.com/)
3. Create a new access token or use the default public token
4. Copy your access token

### 2. Set up GitHub Secret (for deployment)

For automatic deployment with GitHub Actions:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your Mapbox access token (starts with `pk.`)
6. Click **Add secret**

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically inject this token during deployment.

### 3. Local Development

For local development, you can temporarily replace the empty token in `script.js`:

```javascript
// Replace this line in script.js:
mapboxgl.accessToken = '';

// With your actual token:
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_MAPBOX_TOKEN_HERE';
```

### 4. Run the Application

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No server setup required!

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Enter Addresses**: Type in your starting address and destination
2. **Start Navigation**: Click "Start Navigation" to begin
3. **Move Your Car**: Click on roads to move your vehicle (you can only move on roads!)
4. **Reach Destination**: Navigate to the red destination marker
5. **Success**: When you're within 25 meters, you'll see a success message with your completion time
